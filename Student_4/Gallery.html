            Messi signed a two-year deal with PSG in the summer of 2021; his
            term is up for renewal in June, but negotiations are at a
            standstill right.<br><br>
            Lionel Messi finally signed his eagerly anticipated Paris Saint-Germain contract on Tuesday night to complete the move that confirms the end of a career-long association with Barcelona and sends PSG into a new era.The French club said in a statement that the 34-year-old Argentina star signed a two-year deal with the option for a third season.
            “I am excited to begin a new chapter of my career at Paris Saint-Germain," Messi said. "Everything about the club matches my football ambitions. I know how talented the squad and the coaching staff are here. I am determined to help build something special for the club and the fans, and I am looking forward to stepping out onto the pitch at the Parc des Princes.”<br><br>
            No salary details were given, but a person with knowledge of the negotiations earlier told The Associated Press that Messi is set to earn around 35 million euros ($41 million) net annually. The person said on condition of anonymity before the contract was signed.
            “I am delighted that Lionel Messi has chosen to join Paris Saint-Germain and we are proud to welcome him and his family to Paris," PSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi said.

            Max Verstappen has led a swathe of driver criticism of the
            decision-making at the Australian Grand Prix after the race was
            stopped three times because of incidents on track.<br><br>
            Max Verstappen has led a swathe of driver criticism of the decision-making at the Australian Grand Prix after the race was stopped three times because of incidents on track. The world champion dismissed it as a mess and accused the FIA, the governing body, of being responsible.
            Verstappen won in Melbourne with a dominant display but only after three red-flag stoppages, chaos and confusion and the race finishing behind the safety car. The second red flag with four laps to go led to a standing restart from which there were multiple incidents, causing another stoppage and a further 30-minute delay.
            <br><br>“I am very happy to have won, but the race towards the end was a bit of a mess,” he said. “I just didn’t understand why we needed a red flag. It left a lot of drivers confused. If we would have had a safety car and then a normal rolling start we wouldn’t have had all these shunts and then you have a normal finish. So they created the problems themselves.
            “We’ll talk about it, I think it left a lot of drivers confused about why we needed a red flag. We’ll talk in Baku.”
            Questions were also raised as to whether the stoppages, which close the field up and are followed by dramatic standing starts, were being employed merely to improve the spectacle, with six drivers involved in incidents after the second restart.<br>

            free-throw discrepancy</h3>
          <p class="news__content" hidden>
            Let's get this out of the way right away: I think there are good
            reasons to question the integrity of referees prior to Tim
            Donaghy's resignation due to a gambling controversy given the
            egregiousness of calls in a number of NBA playoff games from the
            early 2000s.<br><br>
            I reviewed the NBA's last two-minute reports and created the Restless Nights Index at the time to illustrate how ludicrous that statement was. In the aftermath of that game — one in which the league admitted to blowing the call in question and another that aided the Lakers in the final seconds of regulation — James' team was one of five that actually benefited from bad whistles late in close games at least 59% of the time.
            They remain top five in that respect, and only the two teams that met in last year's Finals — the Celtics and Golden State Warriors — have been on the better side of more blown calls per game in clutch situations.
            An updated table of the number of close games for each team, the total amount of incorrect calls or no-calls in those games, the number of those calls that went in favor of each team and the percentage of favorable calls that each team received:

          <h3 class="news__headline">Maguire's dilemma: Should the Man United club captain leave this summer or fight for his place?</h3>
          <p class="news__content" hidden>
            Harry Maguire will encounter a familiar situation when he returns to Manchester United ahead of their trip to Newcastle United this weekend after playing every minute of England's two Euro qualifiers during the international break.
            Maguire, who is currently all but guaranteed a spot in Gareth Southgate's lineup, must wait anxiously to learn whether he will make his Saint James' Park debut against Erik ten Hag on Sunday.<br><br> Rafael Varane's availability will largely determine his chances of succeeding after sitting out United's most recent match, a 3-1 victory over Fulham, due to injury.
            Varane and fellow World Cup winner Lisandro Martinez are Ten Hag's favoured center-back pairing; as a result, club captain Maguire has spent the majority of the season in that position.<br><br>
            Ten Hag hasn't tried to hide that Varane and fellow World Cup winner Lisandro Martinez are his preferred partnership at centre-back, an arrangement that's meant club captain Maguire has spent most of the season out in the cold. It leaves the 30-year-old with a decision to make in the summer: either stick it out as a bit-part player at Old Trafford, or leave in search of regular football elsewhere.<br><br>
            It says everything about Maguire's predicament that despite playing a part in England's first win in Italy since 1961 on Thursday, he still felt the need to come out fighting after the match.<br><br>
            Ten Hag has been largely supportive of Maguire since taking over as manager, but for many fans, the centre-back remains a symbol of the team that fell apart under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick before the Dutch manager arrived. Maguire was keen to accept the captaincy when it was offered to him by Solskjaer following his £80 million move from Leicester in 2019, but according to sources, it has come with more pressure and scrutiny than he expected.<br><br>
            Maguire lifted his first trophy as United captain in February after a 2-0 win over Newcastle, but it was shared with stand-in skipper Bruno Fernandes after Maguire was only asked to play the final two minutes. The England defender started United's last two games against Real Betis and Fulham, but it was the first time since August he was picked for consecutive matches. He has made just five Premier League starts all season, and two of those were the back-to-back defeats to Brighton and Brentford at the beginning of Ten Hag's reign.

          <h3 class="news__headline">Formula Equal: Bid lodged for a 50:50 male, female F1 team to join in 2026</h3>
          <p class="news__time">2 hours ago</p>
          <p class="news__content" hidden>
            Former British American Racing (BAR) founder Craig Pollock has confirmed he is looking to enter Formula One with a 50 percent male, 50 percent female team called Formula Equal.
            Pollock has submitted an expression of interest to racing's governing body, the FIA, who opened up the process for finding an 11th F1 team earlier this year.<br><br>
            "Our ambition to deliver and build opportunities and pathways for women to get to the very top level inside motorsports," Pollock told CNN Sport. "The concept and the idea was to try and build a Formula 1 team, 50 percent male, 50 percent female, which is extremely hard to do if you have an existing Formula One team; it's a lot easier with a clean sheet of paper."
            Pollock's BAR team raced in F1 between 1999 and 2005, before being purchased by Honda, which became the famous Brawn GP team in 2009 and then Mercedes from 2010 onwards.
            Pollock hopes to include a female driver in the line-up of his new venture, although he admits there are issues with doing that in the next few years.<br><br>
            "We know that we are going to have to go through our academy systems. We know we're going to have to build it up because there are not enough women at the moment who are trained up to the level of Formula One and they've got to earn a place in there at the same time".
            This year Formula One will launch its F1 Academy, a championship series primarily for teenage girls looking to start their journey up the pyramid.<br><br> The series will be closely affiliated with teams who make up the grid of the Formula 3 and Formula 2 feeder series, which F1 hopes will provide a clearer pathway to the top.
            Formula Equal hopes to be "the first Formula One team that is truly outside of Europe", with Pollock revealing that funding discussions have taken place with a Gulf state.
            Saudi Arabia Motorsport Company chairman HRH Prince Khalid bin Sultan Al-Abdullah Al-Faisal said during the recent Saudi Arabian Grand Prix that the nation hopes to have its own race team in the future.
            There have been a few notable expressions of interest about 2026. The bid which gained the most media coverage was the joint Andretti-Cadillac bid, although that was met with a lukewarm response from F1's existing 10 teams, who would still need to sign off any prospective 11th entry.
            There are lingering concerns over adding a new team into the mix and diluting the prize fund for the teams at a time when F1 is enjoying an unprecedented popularity boom.

            When Ayden Khalid initially heard about New York Knicks forward Julius Randle’s plan to donate $500 for every 3-pointer he made to the Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball School, the 3-point specialist at The Dalton School in New York wondered how he could be involved.
            “My main thing is shooting 3s, so I thought it would be pretty cool for me to do it as well,” said Khalid, 16, a junior at the private school that boasts CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and actor Tracee Ellis Ross among its notable alumni. “We notified the Monroe School, created a website and went on from there.”
            When Randle, who announced the program in November 2021, visits the Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball School on Tuesday afternoon, he’ll deliver a check for $880,000 that accounts for the 3-pointers he made last season.<br><br> Randle had long list of matching donors that included the Knicks, JP Morgan and the NBA Players Association.
            And standing with Randle will be Khalid, who’ll present the Monroe School a check for $12,090 for the 3-pointers he made during his just-completed junior season.
            “This is what New Yorkers are about — teammates and winning,” said Monroe who launched the charter school in 2021, with filmmaker Dan Klores. “Having all sorts of New Yorkers from companies, workers, students, fans, the Knicks and Ayden come together for ‘30 for 3’ shows people can work together in a truly meaningful way.”

            In the Swiss Open 2023, a Super 300 competition, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty defeated China's Ren Xiang Yu and Tan Qiang 21-19, 24-22.

            This was the seventh World Tour victory of Rankireddy-career Shetty's and their first BWF doubles victory of the year.
            The victory is a pleasant consolation after they failed to advance past the round of 16 in only one of five previous competitions in 2023.

            United are looking for a striker ahead of the summer transfer window, but Rashford remains a key part of Ten Hag's plans.
            Sources have told ESPN that the club are ready to listen to offers for a number of senior players in a bid to increase the summer budget and navigate financial fair play constraints.
            Scott McTominay, who scored both goals in Scotland's 2-0 win over Spain on Tuesday, is wanted by Newcastle United, while there is also interest from the Premier League and Europe in Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Dean Henderson.
            Eric Bailly and Alex Telles will be allowed to leave permanently after loan spells this season.<br><br>
            Anthony Elanga and Brandon Williams are likely to be made available on loan, and Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe are set to leave at the end of their contracts in June.

            In a statement released late on Tuesday, US based sports agency Roc Nation - which represents Lukaku - demanded Juventus apologise to the striker.
            "Tonight's racist remarks made towards Romelu Lukaku by Juventus fans in Turin were beyond despicable and cannot be accepted," Roc Nation Sports International president Michael Yormark said.
            "Before, during, and after the penalty, he was subjected to hostile and disgusting racist abuse. Romelu celebrated in the same manner he has previously celebrated goals. The referee's response was to award a yellow card to Romelu.<br><br>
            "History repeats... Been through it in 2019.. and 2023 again..," Lukaku said in a post on Instagram on Wednesday.
            "I hope the league really take actions for real this time because this beautiful game should be enjoyed by everyone..."
            Inter also reiterated their stance against racism and expressed their support for Lukaku.
            "We want to firmly reiterate that we stand united against racism and all forms of discrimination," a statement read.<br><br>
            "Football and sport must not only be a place for emotion but also for clear and shared values, and what we saw last night in the final minutes of the Juventus vs Inter Coppa Italia semi-final in Turin has no place in our sport.

            The decision comes amid continuing concerns about boxing's future as an Olympic sport and the participation of Russian and Belarussian teams in the World Championships.

            A spokesperson for GB Boxing explained: "The decision reflects ongoing concerns about the future of boxing's place on the Olympic programme and the recent decision by IBA to allows teams of boxers from Russia and Belarus to compete under their national flags, which contravenes the International Olympic Committee's (IOC's) position on the participation of athletes from these countries.

            Last year, players from Russia and Belarus were banned from Wimbledon in response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
            The Lawn Tennis Association was hit with a fine and world ranking points were removed from last year's championships.<br><br>
            However, the decision has now been reversed and players from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to take part at Wimbledon this summer, subject to them competing as 'neutral' athletes and complying with appropriate conditions.
            The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) said if the ban remained, there was "a real prospect of the termination of our membership", leading to the cancellation of events at Queen's, Eastbourne, Birmingham and Nottingham.<br><br>
            Ian Hewitt, chairman of the All England Club, said: "We continue to condemn totally Russia's illegal invasion and our wholehearted support remains with the people of Ukraine.
